## Responsability of a usecase
- Ideally, one usecase per feature
- Decide which repository to use
- Input parameters => output response
- Only called from BloCs

## Dartz : Left when error  |  Right when success

## Dependent & Dependency
- Code standard
- Moins de productivité
- Plus de consommation de mémoire

## Dependency Provider : use GetIt
+ Lazy Initialization
+ Moins de consommation de mémoire
